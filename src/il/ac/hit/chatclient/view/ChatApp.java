    This file (ChatApp) represents a ChatApp class in a chat client application.
    The ChatApp class represents the main entry point of the chat client application.
    It creates a JFrame (main frame) as the application window, sets its style, and makes it non-resizable.
    It initializes and adds a StartPage component to the main frame, ensuring proper layout, and forces the frame to be repainted for immediate visibility to the user.
